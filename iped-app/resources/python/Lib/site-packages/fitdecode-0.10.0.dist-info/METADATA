A `FIT <https://developer.garmin.com/fit/overview/>`_ file parsing and decoding
library written in `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_ (``>= 3.6``).


Usage Example
=============

Read a FIT file, frame by frame:

.. code:: python

    import fitdecode

    with fitdecode.FitReader('file.fit') as fit:
        for frame in fit:
            # The yielded frame object is of one of the following types:
            # * fitdecode.FitHeader (FIT_FRAME_HEADER)
            # * fitdecode.FitDefinitionMessage (FIT_FRAME_DEFINITION)
            # * fitdecode.FitDataMessage (FIT_FRAME_DATA)
            # * fitdecode.FitCRC (FIT_FRAME_CRC)

            if frame.frame_type == fitdecode.FIT_FRAME_DATA:
                # Here, frame is a FitDataMessage object.
                # A FitDataMessage object contains decoded values that
                # are directly usable in your script logic.
                print(frame.name)


Command line utilities
----------------------

``fitjson`` exports JSON:

::

    $ fitjson --pretty -o out_file.json in_file.fit

To ease the introspection or your FIT files, ``fittxt`` exports to a dedicated
TXT format::

    $ fittxt -o out_file.txt in_file.fit

Both commands accept a ``--filter`` option (or ``-f``) which can be specified
multiples times::

    $ # include only RECORD messages:
    $ fitjson -f=record -o out_file.json in_file.fit

    $ # exclude FILE_ID and EVENT messages:
    $ fitjson -f=-file_id -f=-event -o out_file.json in_file.fit


Installation
============

fitdecode is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/fitdecode/>`_::

    $ pip install fitdecode


Or, to get the latest working version, you can clone fitdecode's `source code
repository <https://github.com/polyvertex/fitdecode>`_ before installing it::

    $ git clone git@github.com:polyvertex/fitdecode.git
    $ cd fitdecode
    $ python setup.py test     # optional step to run unit tests
    $ python setup.py install


Note that for convenience, the ``cmd`` directory located at the root of the
source code tree can safely be added to your ``PATH``, so that fitdecode
commands can be called without the package to be installed.


Overview
========

fitdecode is a non offensive and incompatible rewrite of the fitparse_ library,
with some improvements and additional features, as well as efforts made to
optimize both speed and memory usage.

Main differences between fitdecode and fitparse:

* fitdecode's API is not compatible with fitparse's

* fitdecode requires Python version 3.6 or greater

* fitdecode is faster

* fitdecode allows concurrent reading of multiple files by being thread-safe, in
  the sense that fitdecode's objects keep their state stored locally

* fitdecode does not discard the FIT header and the CRC footer while iterating
  a file, which allow to get a complete 1:1 representation of the file that is
  being read

* This also allows the client to easily deal with so-called chained FIT files,
  as per FIT SDK definition (i.e. concatenated FIT files)

* CRC computation and matching are both optional. CRC can be either matched, or
  only computed, or just ignored for faster reading.

* fitdecode offers optional access to records, headers and footers in their
  binary form, to allow FIT file cutting, stitching and filtering at binary
  level


Why a new library?
==================

A new library has been created instead of just offering to patch fitparse_
because many changes and adds in fitdecode break fitparse's backward
compatibilty and because it allowed more freedom during the development of
fitdecode.


Documentation
=============

Documentation is available at `<https://fitdecode.readthedocs.io/>`_


License
=======

This project is distributed under the terms of the MIT license.
See the `LICENSE.txt <LICENSE.txt>`_ file for details.


Credits
=======

fitdecode is largely based on the generic approach adopted by fitparse_ to
define FIT types and to decode raw values. That includes the module
``profile.py`` and all the classes it refers to, as well as the script
``generate_profile.py``.
