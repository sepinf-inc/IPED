Put in this folder JAR files of optional libraries or plugins.
Usually you can put here libraries with incompatible licenses that will be dynamically loaded at runtime. 

For example:
- java-dbx-1.1-p3.jar (GPL license): to decode DBX mailboxes from old Outlook Express mail client
- jai-imageio-jpeg2000-1.3.0.jar (custom license): to decode uncommon jpeg2000 images (https://github.com/jai-imageio/jai-imageio-jpeg2000)
- stanford-corenlp-3.8.0.jar (GPL license): to enable named entity recognition feature, needs to download models from https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/
