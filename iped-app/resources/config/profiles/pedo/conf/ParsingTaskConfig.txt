# Processes images embedded in PDFs. Must be enabled to extract images from PDFs if they are expanded.
# If enabled, the OCR is applied over embedded images instead of the images generated by the rendering of each page.
# Sometimes the images are fragmented in PDFs, resulting in cut words or lines. In this case this option can be detrimental to the OCR.
# Also, with this option the OCR of jbig2 images in PDFs doesn't work because Tesseract does not support this format.
