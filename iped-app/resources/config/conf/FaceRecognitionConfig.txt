# Face recognition feature based on Face Recognition Project (https://pypi.org/project/face-recognition/)
# You must install python and some dependencies, see: See https://github.com/sepinf-inc/IPED/wiki/User-Manual#facerecognition
# If enabled, you can search for faces from the analysis interface, check the options menu.

# Number of external face recognition processes. If not set, the number of CPU logical cores will be used.
# You can set this if you have memory usage problems, e.g. if you are using a GPU with very few memory.
#numFaceRecognitionProcesses = 4

# Max width or height used to resize images before face detection. This dramatically reduces
# the time of face detection on high resolution images, although small faces are lost.
# This could be increased, but processing time will take much longer.
maxResolution = 1024

# Face detection algorithm. Possible values: 'hog' or 'cnn'.
# The last is more accurate, but is much more slower. It should be used just with a good GPU.
faceDetectionModel = hog

# Number of times the image will be upsampled before recognition. Default is 1x (doubles the image size).
# This improves detection of small faces. But is limited by maxResolution setting.
