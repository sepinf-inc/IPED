# Video Thumbnails Extraction Configuration   #

# MPlayer for Windows is already distributed side by side with this software
# For Linux, mplayer must be compiled and installed on system path.

# The higher the resolution or number of thumbs, the slower the extraction.

# Compression level of the generated image file.
# From 0 to 100, 0 - is very high compression and very low quality, 100 - higher quality and minimum compression.

# Timeouts (in seconds) used by the mplayer monitor.
# Change with caution, because high values can slow down processing of corrupted videos.
# Low values can abort thumb extraction of valid videos.
#    - First execution timeout (must be higher because MPlayer can update its font cache).
#    - Metadata extraction
#    - Thumbnail extraction
