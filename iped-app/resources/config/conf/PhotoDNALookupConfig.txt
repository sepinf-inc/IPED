# Maximum distance between photoDNA hashes to consider two images as similar.
# It is used to look up for photoDNA hashes in a hash database.
# The bigger the number, the look up will be SLOWER and you'll get more false positives and less false negatives.
# Distances below this threshold will set 'photoDnaHit' property as 'true' and will load other properties from the 
# hash database (like 'photoDnaHit:status' and 'photoDnaHit:set', when present).

# Search for photoDNA of rotated (90, 180 and 270 degrees) and flipped images in photoDNA database.
