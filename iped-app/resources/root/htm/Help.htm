        <b>Search Syntax:</b><br />
        <br />
        To open the analysis application, it is required to install Java JRE 8 or newer, a 64bits JRE is highly recommended, download from <a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a>. If your case or report is stored in an optical disk, analysis can become slow. If so, copy the whole case to a local hard disk, from where the analysis application should be opened.<br>
        <br>
        The keyword search looks for terms in file name and contents of textual files, like Word, Excel, PDF, Emails, Internet pages, chats, so on. If enabled, OCR (<i>Optical Character Recognition</i>) technology is used to search for text in image files. However, some results may not be found in low quality or low resolution images, or if fonts are small or uncommon.<br>
        <br>
        The keyword search does not differentiate letter capitalization or accents. <b>But it is recommended to include accents in searches, so keywords will be properly highlighted in "Preview" tab</b>. It is not recommended to search for common or very short keywords, like <b>OF</b>. Below are some search examples:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>1. <b>suspect</b><br/>Search for files containing the exact term <b>suspect</b>. Files containing <b>suspects</b> will not be found.
